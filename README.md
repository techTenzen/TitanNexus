## ✨ Core Features

### 🧠 Multi-Model Intelligence
Harness the cognitive power of industry-leading LLMs including OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Groq, Mistral, and more. Dynamically switch between models to optimize for specific tasks—whether you need deep reasoning capabilities, extended context generation, or lightning-fast execution.

### 💻 WebContainer-Powered Development
Execute Node.js full-stack applications **entirely within your browser**. Install npm packages, run terminal commands, and instantly preview your applications—all without a single local installation.

### 🔍 Intelligent Error Recovery
Titan's AI analyzes runtime logs and exceptions in real-time, suggesting potential fixes or implementing solutions automatically—drastically reducing debugging time and accelerating your development workflow.

### 🧾 Natural Language Programming
Transform plain-language descriptions into complete, functioning codebases. Titan AI intelligently structures project directories, creates necessary files, configures dependencies, and implements business logic from simple prompts.

### 🛠️ Integrated Terminal & Live Preview
Experience the convenience of an embedded command-line interface with real-time execution feedback and application preview—mirroring the functionality of VS Code but accessible from any browser.

### 🗂️ Advanced File System
Navigate a persistent, intuitive file structure with comprehensive file management capabilities—create, edit, rename, and reorganize with familiar drag-and-drop functionality.

### 🔁 Version Control & History
Track every significant code change. Effortlessly revert to previous states, fork alternative implementations, or restore specific versions without manual backups.

### 📦 DevOps Integration
Seamlessly interface with Git repositories, commit changes, and even execute operations within containerized environments—all directly from your browser window.

### 🌍 One-Click Deployment
Export projects as ZIP archives, push directly to GitHub, or deploy instantly to platforms like Netlify, Vercel, and more—turning ideas into live applications in minutes.

### 🌐 Collaborative Development (Coming Soon)
Work simultaneously with team members on shared projects, featuring integrated chat, visual diff comparisons, and synchronized previews—making remote collaboration effortless.
