## 🚀 Revolutionizing Development with AI

**Titan AI** is an open-source, browser-based development platform that brings together powerful AI models and full-stack execution in one seamless interface. Build, test, and deploy apps faster—with real-time collaboration, smart code generation, and zero local setup.

🔗 **Try it live**: [titan1.pages.dev](https://titan1.pages.dev/)

## ✨ Features at a Glance

### 🧠 Multi-Model Intelligence
Leverage top LLMs including OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Groq, Mistral, and more. Switch models dynamically based on use case—deep reasoning, long-form generation, or speed execution.

### 💻 WebContainer-Powered Dev Environment
Run Node.js full-stack apps **entirely in the browser**. Install dependencies, run commands, and preview apps—no installations needed.

### 🔍 AI-Driven Debugging
Titan AI analyzes logs and errors and suggests or applies fixes automatically—streamlining debugging and recovery.

### 🧾 Natural Language to Codebase
Turn prompts into working codebases. Titan structures your folders, files, configs, and logic with a single command.

### 🛠️ Live Terminal & Preview
An embedded terminal lets you run and preview apps side-by-side—just like VS Code, but in your browser.

### 🗂️ Smart File System
Persistent file system with intuitive navigation, editing, renaming, and drag-drop functionality.

### 🔁 Code History & Rollback
Every major change is tracked. Roll back, fork, or restore previous versions with ease.

### 📦 Git & Docker Integrated
Clone repositories, commit changes, and even run everything inside Docker—all from your browser.

### 🌍 Instant Deployment
Export as ZIP, push to GitHub, or deploy directly to Netlify or any platform of your choice.

### 🌐 Real-Time Collaboration (WIP)
Collaborate with peers on the same project with chat, version diffing, and live preview.
