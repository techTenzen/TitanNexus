## 🚀 Revolutionizing Development with AI

**Titan AI** is a groundbreaking development platform that combines the power of multiple AI models with a complete browser-based development environment. Build, test, and deploy full-stack applications entirely in your browser with intelligent AI assistance at every step.

```javascript
// Generate a complete React project with one prompt
const project = await titan.createProject(
  "Create a weather dashboard with real-time updates and dark mode"
);

// Run it instantly in your browser
await titan.deploy(project);
```

## ✨ Features

### 🧠 Multi-Model Integration
Choose from multiple LLM providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Mistral, xAI, Groq, and more. Select the best model for your specific task - use GPT-4 for complex reasoning, Claude for long-context tasks, and Mistral for speed-optimized workflows.

### 💻 Browser-Based Development Environment
Run full-stack Node.js applications directly in your browser using WebContainer technology. No local setup required - install npm packages, run build tools, and test your applications in a virtualized environment.

### 🛠️ Intelligent Error Detection & Recovery
Automatically detect and fix errors in your code. Titan AI monitors terminal output, identifies issues, and generates fixes without manual intervention.

### 📝 Project Generation from Natural Language
Convert natural language descriptions into complete project structures. Titan AI creates directories, files, and configurations based on your description.

### 🖥️ Integrated Terminal & Preview
Access a full-featured terminal directly in your browser. Run commands, view logs, and see your application in real-time with the built-in preview window.

### 📁 Complete File System Management
Work with a persistent virtual file system. Create, edit, and organize files just like in a traditional development environment.

### 🔄 Version Control & Rollback
Revert to earlier versions of your code and track changes throughout your development process.

### 🌐 Seamless Deployment Options
Deploy your projects directly to platforms like GitHub or Netlify with just a few clicks, or download as a ZIP file for local use.

### 🤝 Integrated Community Platform
Share projects, engage in discussions, submit feature requests, report issues, and connect with other developers directly within the Titan AI ecosystem.
